## Submitting a Lesson

You wanna make your own lesson? It's simple!      
Firstly, [fork](https://github.com/superandybean/learning-the-express-way/fork) this repository and then create a markdown (.md or .mdx) file with an appropriate name in the [lessons folder](https://github.com/superandybean/learning-the-express-way/tree/master/lessons). An mdx file is recommended as it allows you to use textbook elements. In the heading of the file, please add the code
```
---
title: 'EXAMPLE TITLE'
slug: /lesson/EXAMPLE_LINK
---
```
where the slug is an appropriate link to your lesson. Example [.md](https://github.com/superandybean/learning-the-express-way/blob/master/lessons/exampleMd.md) and [.mdx](https://github.com/superandybean/learning-the-express-way/blob/master/lessons/exampleMdx.mdx) files are provided, and their results are shown [here](https://lew.sites.tjhsst.edu/template/md) and [here](https://lew.sites.tjhsst.edu/template/mdx) respectively. After that, please update the [lessonList.yml](https://github.com/superandybean/learning-the-express-way/blob/master/data/lessonList.yml) file and add your lesson in the appropriate order. Use the format
```
- title: 'EXAMPLE TITLE'
  description: 'Example description.'
  extraLesson: true
```
where the title name matches exactly with the one found in your markdown file. Additionally, provide a short 1-2 sentence summary of your lesson with the description argument. After that, submit a pull request mentioning what you added in your lesson and tag your pull request with the "new lesson" tag.
