title: Example Md File
slug: /template/md
---

You can look at the source markdown file [here](https://github.com/superandybean/learning-the-express-way/blob/master/lessons/exampleMd.md). Remember to include the frontmatter in the beginning of the file, with the correct title and slug tags! And check that the title is the same as the one you added in the [lessonList.yml](https://github.com/superandybean/learning-the-express-way/blob/master/data/lessonList.yml) file.

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6

The table of contents only works for up to heading 2 though!

> Wow.

Use brackets and parantheses for [links](). One asterick for *italics*, two for **bold**, and three for ***both***!

Lists are easy too.

Just use numbers

1. Like
2. This
3. For
4. A
5. Numbered
6. List

and dashes 

- For
- A
- Bulleted
- List

Inserting an image is just like a link, except you add an exclamation in front!

Finally, for code blocks, use three ticks

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>This is a code block.</h1>
        <h2>You can change the language of the code block by changing the html 
            after the three ticks to another langauge, like css or js.</h2>
    </body>
</html>
```

Want a horizontal line? Use three dashes like so:

Since this is an md file, not an mdx file, you cannot use the other added textbook elements.     

Don't worry about the preivous lesson button below; it's acting weird because this page isn't an actual lesson.
